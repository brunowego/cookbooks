## Issues

### TBD

```log
You don't have permission to view OAuth clients. Required permissions: clientauthconfig.clients.list or clientauthconfig.clients.listWithSecrets, and iam.serviceAccounts.list
```

TODO

<!--
Add `owner` role
-->

### Missing Authorized Redirect URIs

```log
Access blocked: This appâ€™s request is invalid
...
Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch
```

Add "Authorized redirect URIs" in "Client ID for Web application" section.
