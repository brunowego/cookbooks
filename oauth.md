## OAuth2 Flows

### With User Interaction

- Authorization Code Flow: Web application clients
  1. Request authorization (Consent)
  2. Request token
  3. Access resource
- Implicit Flow: Native/local clients
  1. Request authorization & token
  2. Access resource

### Without User Interaction

- Resource Owner Password Credential Flow: "Trusted clients""
  1. Request token with resource owner credentials
  2. Access resource
- Client Credential Flow: Client to service communication
  1. Request token with client credentials
  2. Access resource

## OAuth2 & Authentication

- OAuth2 is for (delegated) authorization
  - Authentication is a pre-requisite for that.
  - Access tolem os for some back-end service
- Sometimes you "just" need authentication
  - (at least to begin with)
  - Identify user in an application
  - Control access to application features
- OAuth2 is regularly "abused" for that
