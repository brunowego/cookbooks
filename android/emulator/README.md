## Issues

### Wrong Architecture

```sh
adb: failed to install <filename>.apk: Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_NO_MATCHING_ABIS: Failed to extract native libraries, res=-113]
```

Check if the architecture of the emulator is the same as the APK.

```sh
#
adb shell getprop ro.product.cpu.abi
```

#### TBD

```log
adb: failed to install ./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-x86_64-debug.apk: Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_TEST_ONLY: installPackageLI]
```

### TBD

```log

Origin 'qrc://' is therefore not allowed access. (qrc:/html/js/location-mock-web-channel.js:0, (null))
