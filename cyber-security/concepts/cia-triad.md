# Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) Triad

## Glossary

- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

## Explanation

### Confidentiality

The confidentiality principle ensures that private information can only be viewed or accessed by individuals who need that information in order to complete their job duties.

Confidentiality can be protected using strong access controls, encryption of data in flight and at-rest, remote wipe capabilities, and information security training for all individuals with access to data.

### Integrity

The integrity principle ensures that data can be trusted to be accurate and that it has not been modified in an unauthorised manner.

Integrity of data can be achieved using encryption, digital certificates, password hashing, digital signatures, intrusion detection systems (IDS), auditing, version control, and strong authentication and authorisation controls.

### Availability

The availability principle ensures that system data is fully available at the point in time when it is needed by its users or other authorised systems.

Availability can be achieved through system redundancy, hardware fault tolerance, ensuring patching and of software and systems, data backups, disaster recovery/failover plans, and protection against denial-of-service (DOS) attacks.
