Hey <Candidate>,

Thanks for your interest in the <RoleName> role. We appreciate you taking the time to apply for the role.

While your experience is impressive, we won't be able to move forward with the role given that we are looking for very specific skill sets in backend systems and blockchain infrastructure. Should anything change on our end, we'll be sure to reach out again. In the meantime, please be sure to also keep an eye out for our careers page as we'll be updating them.

We look forward to connecting with you again in the future!

Thanks,
<YourName>
