#### TBD

```log
Invalid Codegen Configuration!
  Please make sure that your codegen config file contains either the "schema" field
  or every generated file has its own "schema" field.
  It should looks like that:
  schema:
  - my-schema.graphql
  or:
  generates:
  path/to/output:
  schema: my-schema.graphql
â—¼ Generate outputs
```
