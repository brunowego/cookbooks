- Artificial Intelligence (AI): The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, reason, and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI encompasses a wide range of techniques and approaches.
- Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves training models on data and using them to make predictions or decisions.
- Deep Learning (DL): A specialized subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to process and learn from vast amounts of data. Deep learning has been particularly successful in tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
- Data Science (DS): The interdisciplinary field that combines methods, algorithms, processes, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. Data science plays a crucial role in AI and machine learning by providing the data needed for training and evaluation of models.
