## Learning

- Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled data.
- Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm learns from unlabeled data.
- Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns from rewards and punishments.

## Key Ingredients to Build a Machine Learning Model

1. Data: Image/Video, Text (Corpus), Audio/Sound, Time Series/Signals, etc.
2. Model
3. Compute
