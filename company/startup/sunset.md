We're sunsetting Basetool. Click to find out more.

Hey there,
This is bitter-sweet, but we are sunsetting basetool. We couldnâ€˜t find a niche for it. We still think itâ€˜s an amazing piece of software, but it doesnâ€˜t really fix a problem per-se.

This is probably our fault as founders for not doing more due-diligence and research.

Weâ€˜re not going to accept new sign-ups, and the app will be shut down on July 20th 2022. If you still want to use basetool, please clone it from GitHub or use the docker version.

Thank you for the amazing ride.

Adrian and David

PS: Weâ€˜re doing amazing work on Avo. Avo is an app development platform built on top of Ruby on Rails. You can build a modern customer-facing Ruby on Rails admin panel in no-time.

Itâ€˜s also very easy to build internal tools based on Ruby.

Weâ€˜ve seen a lot of success for our customers that are building MVPs for their startups.

Give it a try. We think youâ€˜ll love it ðŸ¤™
