## How it Works

This is the rule: 60% main color + 30% secondary color + 10% accent color.

1. 60% of your design should be your main dominant color, setting the stage for the rest of the colors to shine.
2. 30% of your design should be a complementary color.
3. And finally, 10% of your design should be a bold accent color, grabbing attention and making your design unique.
