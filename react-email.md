### Issues

#### TBD

```log
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

TODO

#### TBD

```log
Attempted import error: '../../emails/authentication-magic-link.tsx' does not contain a default export (imported as 'Mail').
```

TODO

#### TBD

```log
âœ˜ [ERROR] Could not resolve "react/jsx-runtime"
```
