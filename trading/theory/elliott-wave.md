## Types

- Motive Waves
  - Price movements or waves that are aligned with the larger trend
  - Can be classified as "impulse" waves or "diagonal" waves depending on the form and location with the overall structure
    - Impulse Wave: Typically three sub-waves or flat structures, zigzag structures, triangle structures
    - Diagonal Wave: Looks like a wedge - Either expanding or contracting
- Corrective Waves
  - Price movements are waves that are contrary to the larger trend
  - Typically three sub-waves (ABC pattern) or flat structures, zigzag structures, triangle structures

## Waves

### Wave 1

- Prices begin to bounce higher after a long sustained downtrend
- The sentiment in the market is very bearish at the start of wave one
- Most people see this upside price movement as just a bear market rally, as a good opportunity to initiate a new short position or add to their existing short positions
- 5 smaller waves
- A new swing high is reached, and prices begin will move lower in a bearish direction once again
- Previous swing breakout

### Wave 2

- Moves counter to wave 1, and will retrace a large portion of wave 1
- Wave 2 will retrace wave 1 by either a 50% retracement, 61% retracement, or even 78% retracement
- Investors and traders begin to feel assured once again that the downtrend has continued. However, the market will fail to break below the wave one low
- The retracement will be fairly deep and will take the form of a zigzag correction, or a flat correction

### Wave 3

- It's usually the biggest and most powerful wave within the overall Elliott wave structure
- The sentiment in the market is generally one of growing optimism
- Wave 1 swing high broken: After the break of the swing high of wave one, prices will begin to accelerate upward as more and more traders recognize the bullish sentiment and start taking long positions
- Stops triggered: Many sellers will have their stops triggered at the wave 1 swing high, wish adds further fuel to the upper price momentum
- Join the trend as quickly as possible in order to take advantage of the explosive moves that are characteristic of wave 3
- Wave 3 offers very little in the way of pullbacks, and when they are present, they tend to be quite shallow
- Projection
  - Wave 3 will often travel 1.618 times the length of wave 1 measured from the end of wave 2
  - The second most common projection for wave 3 is for it travel 2.618 times the length of wave 1 measured from the end of wave 2
- Extended Wave: Among wave 1, 3 and 5 of impulse sequence, there will be one extended wave which is quite a bit larger than the other who. In most cases, wave 3 will be that extended wave

### Wave 4

- Wave 4 will be a shallower retracement, and will often terminate at 38% or 50% of wave 3 (less aggressive in percentagem terms than wave 2)
- Unbreakable Rule: Wave 4 should not overlap in the territory of wave 1
- Wave 4 is also often seen as a profit-taking wave (traders that bought early in wave 3 will begin to liquidate their positions and lock in their profits)
- During wave 4 you will often see sideways price movement that is often prolonged in nature
- Wave 4 often takes the form of a triangle. However, it can also be a flat formation, and sometimes it forms as a zigzag pattern or some combination
- Price action often appears range bound and often generates false breakout on either side of the market
- Whipsawing Price Action: Directionless Market - Be careful when taking new positions during wave 4

### Wave 5

- Moves in the direction of the overall trend similarly to waves 1 and 3
- During the progression of wave 5, almost everyone is bullish
- During wave 5, most retail investors are driving prices higher, often to extreme valuations
- Momentum behind the bullish activity in wave 5 will be less dynamic than that during the wave 3 progression
- Indicators VS Price Action: Momentum Divergences - Technical divergence patterns form between price action and many momentum indicators
- The velocity of the price movement higher is diminishing, and you should expect the upside trend to reverse its course soon
- Lower Volume: Along with momentum divergences, wave 5 will often register lower volume compared to wave 3
- Projection: Wave 5 will terminate upon reaching a length that is equivalent to the length seen in wave 1. The next most likely projection for wave 5 is for it to travel a distance of 61% the length of wave 1 (measured from the end of wave 4)
- Corrective Structure: The end of wave 5 brigs with it the completion of the impulse sequence

### Wave A

- Most traders are still very bullish, and consider the wave A pullback as just another minor retracement
- Wave A is somewhat similar to wave 1 in its structure
- Wave A is often a sharp move and may subdivide as either a five wave pattern or a three wave pattern

### Wave B

- Wave B is often considered a bull trap, because it tends to draw in a lot of traders, believing that the existing trend is still healthy
- Short-lived Pattern: Wave B will often fail to surpass the wave 5 swing high
- Wave 5 High: Wave B will try to test the wave 5 extreme and in most cases will fail to breach it
- Wave B is often a fairly deep retracement and will retrace wave A by either 50%, 61%, or 78%
- The subdivision within wave B itself is often seen as a zigzag pattern, but sometimes it will form as a triangle as well

### Wave C

- Swing Low Breakout: Turning point where more and more traders will become convinced that the uptrend has actually ended
- Wave C has manu of the same characteristics as wave 3. Both tend to be relatively long waves and can be quite powerful from the momentum standpoint
- Projection: Wave C will travel a distance of 1.27 times the length of wave A. The next most likely area for wave C to terminate would be when it has traveled the distance of 1.61 times the length the wave A

## Rules

<!-- - Not consider wicks -->

- Waves 1, 3 and 5 are impulses (trending)
- Waves 2 and 4 are corrections of impulses waves 1 and 3
- Waves 2 and 4 must display alternation in as many ways as possible (must be different)
- Wave 2 cannot retrace below the start of wave 1
- Wave 3 cannot be the shortest amongst waves 1, 3 and 5
- Wave 4 does not invade wave 1

- A: Sharp move against trend
- B: Small movement back in direction of trend
- C: Last sharp movement against trend

### Alternation - Wave 2 and wave 4

- Price: Wave 2 when compared to wave 4 may be obviously smaller/larger in price
- Time: Wave 2 when compared to wave 4 may take much more/less time
- Pattern: Wave 2 may be a simple ABC. Wave 4 could be a more complex ABC or even a triangle. Wave 2 could be a flat formation. Wave 2 could be a zigzag.

## Tips

- The first wave is from the big player (smart money/big money)
- One eye on price the other on volume
- Pulled with volume, wait for correction with less volume
- Wave 3 can never be the smallest of waves. Wave 3 doesn't have to be the biggest, it just can't be the smallest. If 3 was the lowest in the wave count, it is because it counted wrong.
- Every impulse undergoes a corrective reaction
