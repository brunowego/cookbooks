## Rules

- Use line chart to look for pivots
- Always check past levels in weekly and monthly timeframe
- After level test, move to next level
- **Try:** Orders in the book with a "short stop" for weekly and monthly levels

## Good Practices

- Keep only one level up and one level down per timeframe (day/week/month)

## Entry Methods

### With Stochastic RSI

- Works with monthly, weekly and daily levels
- Check the daily bias
- Check if the asset already comes from a strong correction
- See if there is a reversal candle or change in market structure
- Entry Positions:
  - Uptrend/Long: Below 20, preferably close to 0
  - Downtrend/Short: Above 80, preferably close to 100
