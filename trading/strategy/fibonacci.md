# Fibonacci

Don't try to guess the market, react to the market.

<!--
Don't try to guess, react.

## Rules

- Trace obligatorily considering wicks
- Consider retraction/extension only with closed candle bodies inside the level
- Wicks can retest levels without closing the body
- Wait for a reversal candle on the level
