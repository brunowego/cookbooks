## Ratios

### Retracement/Retraction

<!--
- **-1:**
- **-0.618:**
- **-0.414:**
- **-0.272:**

Trend-Based Fib Extension: Não pode haver pivô no meio da extensão

- **0:**
- **0.130:**

- **0.236:** This is derived by dividing one number in the sequence by the number three places to the right (i.e. 89/377) (not commonly used - I personally do not use this but I feel as though it should be included)
- **0.382:** Another important level derived by dividing one number in the sequence by the number two places to the right (i.e. 89/233)
- **0.500:** This is not really a Fibonacci level but it represents 50% of a given value. This tends to be powerful in an “orderly” world.
- **0.618:** This is the most significant Fibonacci level and it is derived by dividing one number in the sequence by the following (i.e. 89/144)
- **0.786:** This is the square root of 0.618
- **0.886:** This is the square root of 0.786
- **1.000:** Again, not really a Fibonacci level however, it represents one whole. A nice round number. Very orderly.

### Extension/Projection

- **1.000:** Again, not really a Fibonacci level however, it represents one whole. A nice round number. Very orderly.
- **1.130:** This is the fourth route of 1.618 or square root of 1.272
- **1.272:** This is the square root of 1.618
- **1.382:** This is the addition of 0.382 to 1.000 (one whole or 100%)
- **1.414:** This is the square root of 2.000
- **1.618:** This is the most significant Fibonacci level and its derivation has been described above. However, it can also be calculated as 1 / 0.618
- **2.000:** This is not really a Fibonacci level but it is double a particular value (200%)

## Complementary Derived Ratios

- **0.382:** (1 - 0.618) or 0.618e2
- **0.500:** 0.770e2
- **0.707:** Square root of 0.50
- **1.410:** Square root of 2.0
- **2.000:** 1 + 1
- **2.240:** Square root of 5
- **2.618:** 1.618e2
- **3.141:** Pi
- **3.618:** 1 + 2.618

## Rules

- Trace obligatorily considering wicks
- Consider retraction/extension only with closed candle bodies inside the level
- Wicks can retest levels without closing the body
- Wait for a reversal candle on the level

## Candle-based Entry Map

| Type                 | Candlestick Strength   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Weak (0.236/0.382)   | Weak, Medium ou Strong |
| Medium (0.5)         | Medium ou Strong       |
| Strong (0.618/0.786) | Strong                 |

<!-- ## Tips

- Greater than 0.382 indicates Bullish Flag **Tip:** Check if the volume is downward
- Between 0.5 and 0.618 indicates Symmetrical Triangle -->

## Numbers Probability

### Retracement Levels

- **0.236:** Unfinished move (-0.414)
- **0.382:** Trend continuation (-0.272)
- **0.500:** Top retest (0)
- **0.618:** Pivot retest (0.236)
- **0.786:** Base retest (0.382 or 1.272)

## Entry Methods

<!-- ### With RSI

- Check if is oversold/overbought -->

### With Stochastic RSI

<!--
4h TF
-->

- Attention to the retest of the zone between 0.5 and 0.618
- Check the daily bias
- See if there is a reversal candle or change in market structure
- Entry Positions:
  - Uptrend/Long: Below 20, preferably close to 0
  - Downtrend/Short: Above 80, preferably close to 100

<!--
- Be patient, wait for the K line change direction.
