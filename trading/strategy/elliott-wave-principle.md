## Rules

- Waves 1, 3 and 5 are impulses
- Waves 2 and 4 are corrections of impulses 1 and 3
- Wave 2 cannot retract more than the beginning of wave 1
- Wave 3 cannot be the smallest
- Wave 4 does not invade wave 1

**Tip:** RSI (indicator) divergence is common in wave 5.

- A: Sharp move against trend
- B: Small movement back in direction of trend
- C: Last sharp movement against trend

## Tips

- The first wave is from the big player (smart money/big money)
- One eye on price the other on volume
- Pulled with volume, wait for correction with less volume
- Wave 3 can never be the smallest of waves. Wave 3 doesn't have to be the biggest, it just can't be the smallest. If 3 was the lowest in the wave count, it is because it counted wrong.
- Every impulse undergoes a corrective reaction
