# AngularJS

## Syntax

### Debugging

```html
<!-- AngularJS -->
<code>
  <pre>{{object | json}}</pre>
</code>

<!-- Native JS -->
<code>
  <pre><script>document.write(JSON.stringify(object))</script></pre>
</code>
```

## Issues

### Missing File

```log
The resource from “[URL]” was blocked due to MIME type (“text/html”) mismatch (X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff).
```

Try look if file exists.
