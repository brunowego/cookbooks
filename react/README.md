## Tips

### Visual Studio Code

```sh
#
code --install-extension dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets

#
jq '."recommendations" += ["dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets"]' "$PWD"/.vscode/extensions.json | sponge "$PWD"/.vscode/extensions.json
```

## Issues

### TBD

```log
Type error: Type '{ children: ReactNode; }' has no properties in common with type 'IntrinsicAttributes'.
```

TODO

### Missing JSX Provider

```log
Cannot use JSX unless the '--jsx' flag is provided
```

Check `./tsconfig.json` if `include` is set to `["src"]`.

<!-- **Refer:** `./tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react"
  }
}
``` -->

### Missing Use Effect

```log
Warning: Cannot update a component (`I18nProvider`) while rendering a different component (`LanguageProvider`). To locate the bad setState() call inside `LanguageProvider`, follow the stack trace as described in https://reactjs.org/link/setstate-in-render
```

```tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react'

export function LanguageProvider() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  }, [])

  // ...
}
```

### TBD

```log
Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, ``. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted â€” the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version.
```

### Encountered Two Children with the Same Key

```log
This JSX tag's 'children' prop expects a single child of type 'ReactChildren', but multiple children were provided. ts(2746)
```

Solution [here](https://sentry.io/answers/defining-proper-key-in-props/).

### TBD

```log
TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
```

TODO

### TBD

```log
Warning: Cannot update a component (`Router`) while rendering a different component (`GoBack`). To locate the bad setState() call inside `GoBack`, follow the stack trace as described in https://reactjs.org/link/setstate-in-render
```
