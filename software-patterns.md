Welcome Back to Envato

Hello Bruno Wego,

We noticed you recently signed in to your Envato account. Welcome back!

When and where this happened:

Browser: Firefox 73.0
Operating System: Macintosh 10.15
Approximate Location: Brasília, Federal, Brazil
We strongly recommend enabling Two Factor Authentication (2FA) on your account: it only takes a minute and it’s the best way of keeping your account secure.

This wasn't you? Please be sure to change your password straightaway and to use a strong password that you've not used anywhere else.

For further help and precautions, please contact Help and Support
Thanks,
